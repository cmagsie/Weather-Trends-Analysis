# Weather-Trends-Analysis

In this particular project, I conducted an analysis of temperature data, both locally and globally, and undertook a comparative assessment of temperature trends in Egypt, where I reside, in relation to global temperature trends.

To access the necessary data, I efficiently extracted temperature data. I gathered temperature records for both worldwide trends and the most significant cities proximate to my location, specifically, Cairo and Alexandria. I proficiently employed SQL for database interaction.

The culmination of this analysis was the creation of a line chart. This chart effectively contrasts temperature trends between Cairo and Alexandria with global temperature patterns. Importantly, I opted to plot moving averages instead of annual averages to enhance the visual representation, smoothing the lines and rendering trends more discernible.

The results of this analysis, along with detailed observations, are encapsulated in a comprehensive PDF report. These observations encompass an in-depth exploration of commonalities and distinctions among global averages, as well as temperature averages for Cairo and Alexandria. Moreover, the report encapsulates overarching temperature trends for a holistic understanding of the data.
